The clock has rung, so I finally opened my eyes
I caught a cold yesterday, and that feels a little like a lie
Though I try to go out, ah, the weather forecast said it's probably going to rain today
The dawn won't come, so I won't go out either way

Being thirsty, or feeling pain in the heart -
All the human parts of me are in the way

I raise my head, because of how fast "goodbye" came
If someday the dawn finally comes...
Please, wake up already, look,
I have pictured you half-asleep so many times

It's good that I finally got out my umbrella and decided to try to go out, but I think maybe I've thrown away my shoes
There's no way that I'd have the courage to go barefoot
I guess I don't really care
What do I want to do?

What should I have for dinner?
I think I'll go out when it clears up
I really prefer not to see any humans, though

With this pace, I'll swim through today
If my hand could finally touch you...
Please, wake up already, look,
Because even if I forget, I'll always remember the half-asleep you

Before the hill, you're there, saying "It's been a long while, huh?"
While smiling and bringing your face closer to me
"Well, let's go. Just the two of us." You say

Below the barn in Lapland,
The old street of Gamla Stan,
The summer grass is getting in the way

With this pace, I'll swim through today
If my hand could finally touch you...

Please, wake up already, look
At me, who's forgotten you

I raise my head, because of how fast "goodbye" came
If someday the dawn finally comes...
Please, wake up already, look,
I have pictured you half-asleep so many times
